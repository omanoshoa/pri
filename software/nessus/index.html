							<p>Nessus is a proprietary vulnerability scanner developed by Tenable Network Security. It is free of charge for personal use in a non-enterprise environment</p>

												<li>Remote and local security: Whether they are running Windows, Mac or a Unix system, Nessus is perhaps the only security scanner that has the capability to detect not only the remote flaws of the hosts that are on a network, but their missing patches and local flaws as well.</li>
												<li>Up-to-date security vulnerability database: By using the command Nessus-update-plugins, The Nessus security checks database (which is updated on a daily basis) can be retrieved.</li>
												<li>Plug-ins: Each security test is materialized as an external plug-in, written in NASL, which means that updating Nessus does not involve downloading potentially threatening binaries from the internet.</li>
												<li>Scalable: Nessus will quickly exploit the systems strengths, so it can increase its scanning efficiency. The more power you give to it, the faster it will scan a network.</li>
												<li>NASL: Nessus includes NASL, (Nessus Attack Scripting Language) a language designed to rapidly write security test.</li>
												<li>Smart service recognition: It isnâ€™t in Nessus beliefs that the target hosts will respect the IANA assigned port numbers. Thus it will identify a FTP server running on a non-standard port, or a web server running on port 8080.</li>
												<li>Multiple services: Nessus will test all of the services that are run twice or more by a host run.</li>
												<li>Full SSL support: Nessus has the capability to test SSLized services such as https, smtps, imaps, and can even be supplied with a certificate so that it can be integrated into a PKI type environment.</li>
												<li>Non-destructive or thorough: Nessus gives you the option to either perform a regular non-destructive security audit on a daily basis, or to throw everything you can at a remote host to test its mettle, and see how it will withstand attacks from intruders</li>
												<li>The biggest user base: Nesus has approximately at least 50.000 users worldwide and there could potentially be even more, if the daily downloads of it are taken into account</li>
												<li>Proven maturity: The first public release of Nessus was in 1998. The technology behind it has been extensively tested and perfected, on huge networks over time</li>
